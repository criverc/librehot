[**Libre Handsontable**](//handsontable.com) is the forked version of handsontable from last point where it was free (as in freedom) software.
I don't pretend to replace handsontable. This is just a personal fork so I can add modifications to the version that I use at work for an
in-house development. However if like me, you are also stuck in this last free version because of your conscience, please feel free to contribute,
maybe we can improve it, patches are welcome!!
